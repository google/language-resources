r"""Simplified text I/O module that hard-wires UTF-8 text encoding.

Typical use case:

>>> with utf8.open('/tmp/foo', 'w') as f:
...   utf8.Print(u'\u00A1Hola, mundo!', file=f)

This is to work around two kinds of issues in Python:

* Limited compatibility between Python 2 and 3 when it comes to Unicode string
  handling, especially concerning I/O. This module is written to work directly
  with both Python 2 and 3, without the need for 2to3 conversion or the 'six'
  compatibility module.

* Unexpected default behavior of text I/O in the Python standard library across
  all versions. The problem is that the standard library is trying a bit too
  hard to adapt its I/O behavior to its environment, as specified by environment
  variables, terminal properties, etc. This makes it difficult to predict the
  behavior of a program in isolation. E.g. seemingly straightforward and docile
  scripts can behave differently when stdout is connected to a terminal
  vs. piped into a pager. Tests can behave differently when run in a user's
  shell environment vs. a sterile test environemnt that clears out most
  environment variables.

The present module aims to address both issues by providing drop-in replacements
for well-known Python functions and objects. Only one encoding is supported,
which is fixed to UTF-8, cannot be passed as an argument, and is not inferred
from the environment.

The replacement for the Python print() function (the default in Python 3 and
available via __future__.print_function in Python 2) is called Print()
here. This is done in order to avoid syntax errors when used in Python 2 legacy
code when 'print' cannot be used a function name. If a lower-case function name
print() is desired, this can be done by definining:

>>> from __future__ import print_function
>>> def print(*objects, **kwargs):
...   Print(*objects, **kwargs)

The import of print_function ensures that 'print' parses as an identifier rather
than a keyword, so that it can be used as a function name.
