"""Simple pattern-based encoding classification of Burmese strings.

Reads line-by-line from stdin and writes TSV format to stdout. Each input line
should consist of Myanmar codepoints, as produced by extract_text.py. The TSV
output is of the form Label TAB Line, where Label can be one of:

* "Not Myanmar": The line contains codepoints outside of the Myanmar Unicode
  blocks.

* "Neither": The line is neither consistent with Zawgyi nor with Unicode 5.1
  encoding of Burmese.

* "Zawgyi": The line is consistent with Zawgyi font encoding of Burmese,
  but not with Unicode 5.1 encoding of Burmese.

* "Unicode": The line is consistent with Unicode 5.1 encoding of Burmese,
  but not with Zawgyi font encoding of Burmese.

* "Zawgyi|Unicode": The line is consistent with both Zawgyi and Unicode 5.1
  encoding of Burmese, but its meaning differs between those encodings.

* "Consensus": The line is consistent with both Zawgyi and Unicode 5.1
  encoding of Burmese and has the same meaning in both encodings.

This script is only useful when the underlying language is Burmese. It is
easily confused by other languages written in the Myanmar script and is not
designed to be used for language detection. Examples (all in Unicode):

* "တူ" is classified as "Consensus", but in addition to Burmese it could be a
  Mon or a Shan word.

* The Shan word "မိူင်း" is classified as "Zawgyi|Unicode".

* "တီႇသႅမ်ႇပႃႇ" is the Shan transliteration of "December", but it is classified
  as "Zawgyi".
